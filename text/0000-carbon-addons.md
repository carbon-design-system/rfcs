# Summary

A Carbon Addon is a component library that acts as an extension of the Carbon Design System. A Carbon Addon component also adheres to some development rules:

- Responsive
- Fully Tested
- Reusable
- Integrated into the Carbon Ecosystem
- Accessible

Carbon Addons can also contain connections to APIs and components that are already hooked up to databases.

#### Goals of a Carbon Addon
- To decrease front end development time.
- To encourage consistency across a single business unit.
- To create a centralized place for reusable front end development patterns within a business unit.
- To allow for more reusability across IBM and across business units.

#### Goals of the Carbon Addon Tooling
- To make it easier to build Carbon Addons.
- To abstract any foundational aspects.
- To create seamless development and documentation.
- To allow any business unit or developer to create a new Addons package.
- To enable front end developers around IBM to build in a consistent way.
- To create a centralized place for reusable front end development patterns within IBM.


# Basic example
Carbon Addons are broken down into a few high-level concepts or utilities.

### Components (Addon)
Components are created based on predefined templates. A component can be anything from a standard dumb component, a specific variation of a Carbon component, a function that retrieves data from an API, a smart component that is attached to an API, or anything that is templated. By default, all components for a specific Addon library will be under the `/components` folder. All components also come with MDX documentation.

### Docs (Addon)
A docs library is autogenerated using gatsby-theme-carbon for each component library. These docs can have custom md and mdx files, but also automatically import the MDX docs files from the components folder.

### Templates (Tooling)
Templates are how we define what a component can be. A template will provide a required folder structure and built-in synchronization with various utilities. These templates can be used to speed up the development of new components.

Here are some examples of potential templates:

##### View
A view component is essentially a dumb component. This component is responsive, accessible, and fully tested.

##### Data Hooks
A data hook is a way to make an API call using React Hooks and Graphql.

##### Connected
A connected component is a smart component in that it is already hooked up to a data source.

### CLI (Tooling)
The CLI is the main way of creating and interacting with a Carbon Addon. With the CLI a user can create a new library, create a new component from a template, develop the components or docs, build the components or docs, or publish the components and docs.

### Dev Server (Tooling)
The Development server is a basic Parcel server that is used to develop the Carbon Addon components. This can be customized to use a custom server through the CLI so you can properly make API calls without CORs issues.

The development server will render a selected MDX file for development, meaning that the components docs are also the component's development environment.

### Utilities (Tooling)
Utilities are libraries that help abstract complex development aspects around components. Here are examples of a few potential utility libraries.

##### Docs Components
Components used for the development of components with the dev server or display of components on the docs.

##### Data Hooks
An abstraction for making API calls with React hooks. This library provides a client-side cache and optimistic updates for Data Hooks.

### Example Carbon Addon Structure
All of these pieces add up to a working component library with a minimal amount of foundational development. For example, a Carbon Addon Libray would look something like this:

```
/components
    /connected
        /ResourcePageHeader

    /datahooks
        /useResource
            index.js
            request.js
            useResource.js
            code.mdx
            useResource.test.js
    /views
        /PageHeader
            index.js
            PageHeader.js
            PageHeader.test.js
            code.mdx
            usage.mdx
            styles.mdx
            translations.js
/docs
package.json
.travis.yml
.babelrc.json

```

# Motivation
- Carbon Addons throughout IBM today are very scattered. They have completely different goals, patterns, and level of dedication from their development teams. Because each Carbon Addon functions completely differently there isn't a lot of room for work to be shared across Carbon Addons.

- There is also a significant amount of work needed to set up and maintain a Carbon Addon. Development team's across business units spend a significant amount of time solving the same problems or building the same components. As of right today, Carbon is the only real standard across UI development within IBM. However, Carbon's mission and plans only extend to the design system.

- Carbon covers a high level need for UI product developers when it comes to low level components. However, in many of our products there is a futher need to share components that are more specific than Carbon will ever want to contain. Today, there isn't an established pattern for how to share those product specific components.

## Components
Components are the real substance of a Carbon Addon. They are the output or the primary goal. Most of the other pieces of a Carbon Addon solely exist to support components.

In order to help keep consistency between different Carbon Addons, components are built based on [templates](https://github.com/loganmccaul/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-carbon-addons.md#templates-carbon-addons-templates). Custom components are not allowed in order to maintain reusability. If a new type of component is needed then a new template can be created. That is to say, templates should not be limiting.

In similar fashion to Storybook and in order to encourage documentation of components, the development is done through the [development server](https://github.com/loganmccaul/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-carbon-addons.md#templates-carbon-addons-templates) which will load the code.mdx file (by default) attached to the component. This will render the same screen that will be published to the docs and can utilize docs components for demonstration purposes.

The [CLI](https://github.com/loganmccaul/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-carbon-addons.md#templates-carbon-addons-templates) tool can be used to select one or more components to develop at a time. Allowing for Carbon Addon developers to focus on a specific task.

Using the provided CI config files components can be easily set up to manually publish using lerna or semantic release. I am still not sure of the best way to handle versioning between different libraries or with Carbon. I would love to hear any ideas.

Components can also include other Docs files. For example, a View component has the `code.mdx` file, but also `styles.md` and `usage.mdx`. These docs files should be included in the mdx frontmatter as tabs and are used to showcase design documentation.

## Docs

Using the built-in devops scripts all components in a Carbon Addon are automatically documented and published to a Github Pages site. When a component is updated its latest docs will automatically be published when that component is merged into master. This allows for the Addon library and the documentation to always be 100% in sync and is one of the most valuable parts of the Carbon Addons tooling.

The docs site uses [Carbon's Gatsby Theme](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/gatsby-theme-carbon) with only a slight modification to load the components docs from the installed components package. This makes sure documentation across Carbon and Carbon Addons are consistent in the way they look. It also means any md or mdx file can be added manually for extra documentation such as a Getting Started doc.

The component's docs layout is specified within the template for the component. When a new component is created a base level docs file will be created with the required and optional section headers already prefilled. Unit tests determine if a new component's docs have been updated, and have changed enough to be considered fully documented. This helps automate the process of checking to make sure docs are up to date.

## Development Server

A default development server helps run the component's mdx files for development. By default, the server is just a simple Parcel server. However, the development server can be customized and run inside predefined development environments.

The development server uses a node JS script to create a development.js file with the select components and their styles as imports. This is how we manage to load individual components for development instead of the entire library.

Some default styles are included with the development server to give a slightly more realistic layout. By default, the development server will set the content to have a max width and be centered on the page. It also loads the MDX content using the same patterns that the Carbon website uses.

Often, especially when working with APIs, you will need to run the development server within an already established development ecosystem. In order to amend the default development server, an express app can be provided with the `--server` flag. Furthermore, you may need to set environment variables in order for your server to run properly, these can be set with the `--config` flag.

## Templates (carbon-addons-templates)

Templates are the basis of every component. They can significantly decrease the time it takes to make a new component and enforce consistency across different Carbon Addons libraries. If components are the most important part of a Carbon Addon, templates are the most important part of the tooling.

A template is essentially a grouping of partially complete files. The template defines each file that is required for a specific type of component and also prefills many utility functions, documentation sections, and other optional or required aspects of a component. At best a template can abstract away a significant percentage of the development work needed to create a new component.

There is no real limit to what a template can be. All Carbon Addon libraries should have access to any available template. If the existing templates don't meet a specific component need, a new template can be created.

Below are some examples of potential templates, their description, and a rough outline of their structure. The first three are in use within the Cloud business unit today, thus they are a little more concrete.

#### Views
View components are presentation components. View components should only be concerned with how something is displayed. These make them very similar to Carbon components and with Carbon 11 coming up View components may not be needed. However, because this is a Carbon Addon View components can be a little more strict on the options the let consumer's customize.

**File Structure**

| File | Description | Prefilled Code (%) | Required |
|:------------- |:------------------------------|-----:| -----:|
| index.js | Exports the View Component. | 100 | Yes|
| (NAME).js | The primary React component. | 20| Yes|
| (NAME).js | The tests for the primary React component. |20| Yes|
| _styles.scss | Styles for this View component. Prefixed with a chosen prefix for this Addon. Styles are in scss to match how Carbon handles styling. | 01 | Yes|
|code.mdx| The documentation mark down file for this component. | 20 | Yes|
|usage.mdx| The design documentation for how this component should be used.| 00| Yes|
|style.mdx| Design documentation on the style of this component.| 00 |Yes|
| skeleton.js| The loading skeleton for this component. | 20|No|

#### Data Hooks
Data hooks are an easy way of making API requests using React Hooks.  Data Hooks can be loaded into any functional react component and can retrieve data (GET) or modify data (POST) . Data Hooks are automatically cached on the client side, can utilize optimistic updates for Modify calls, and can return mock responses for local development and documentation.

Data hooks are meant to make development with APIs on the front end significantly easier by creating a library of API calls that can be utilized without a ton of background knowledge.

Every data hook will always return in the structure:

```
{
    key: STRING,
    loading: Boolean,
    Error: Object || null
    data: Object || null
    ...
}
```
among other properties. This is heavily inspired by Apollo.

**File Structure**

| File | Description | Prefilled Code (%) | Required |
|:------------- |:------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| index.js | Exports the Data Hook. | 100 | Yes|
| (NAME).js | The primary React hook. | 100| Yes|
| (NAME).js | The tests for the primary React hook .|70| Yes|
|request.js| A fetch call that actually makes the request. This is also exported within the index file for non React developers.| 30| yes|
| mock.js | A file that returns either a mock object (retrieve) or a mock function (modify). | 05 | Yes|
|schema.js| Controls the docs for the params, query, and response. If it's a Graqphl request this is used as the provided schema.| 05 | Yes|
|code.mdx| Documentation on how to make the API request and use the Data Hook.| 05| Yes|

#### Connected
Connected components are made up of one or more Views and one or more Data Hooks. Essentially making these components "smart" components. Connected components are used to decrease the knowledge an outside development team needs to implement a common pattern. For example, in Cloud a detail page header that loads some basic information is a great use case for a Connected component.

**File Structure**

| File | Description | Prefilled Code (%) | Required |
|:------------- |:------------------------------|:-----| :-----|
| index.js | Exports the Connected Component. | 100 | Yes|
| (NAME).js | The primary React component. | 80| Yes|
| (NAME).js | The tests for the primary React component. |40| Yes|
| _styles.scss | Styles for this Connected component. Prefixed with a chosen prefix for this Addon. Styles are in scss to match how Carbon handles styling. | 80 | Yes|
|code.mdx| The documentation mark down file for this component. | 20 | Yes|
|usage.mdx| The design documentation for how this component should be used.| 00| Yes|
|style.mdx| Documentation on the style of this component.| 00 |Yes|

#### Hosted
A hosted component has the same developer experience as a Connected component, but is rendered through an API request that gets its bundle. This allows for every instance of this component to be the exact same version no matter where it's used.

#### Layout
A layout component can define an overall structure of a page and allow the user to pass in different components or elements in a specific order. This can be used to make similar types of pages have a consistent layout, as well as restrict specific components from being rendered in different parts of a page.

#### Data Helpers
Data helpers map an API response to the props of a presentational component. Data Helpers could be used along with Data Hooks and View components to create Connected components where each piece is a standalone aspect. Data helpers could also be used to normalize API responses into a more common object structure.


## Utilities (carbon-addon-utilities)

Utilities are helper libraries that support component development, abstracting aspects of templates, or documentation. Here are some examples

#### Accessibility
The accessibility utility is a plugin that autoruns the latest A11y rules from IBM's accessibility team on all components. This could help make sure that development is accessible before an audit comes around. It could also be integrated into the devops practices to prevent commits that are inaccessible.

#### Devops
Devops is included with each Carbon Addon. The devops handles releasing new versions of a Carbon Addon as well as updating and publishing the latest docs. This is all handled through various devops scripts that will build the latest package version and install it on the docs site.

#### Other
There is a significant amount of other possible utilities. The goal of a utility should be to abstract as much from component development as possible to allow developers to focus on the specific component they need instead of any foundational work.

# Drawbacks

- These practices may be too restrictive for all IBM teams.
- Each Addon will probably initially need a dedicated maintenance team. Ideally, we can build a system to remove this need.
- All of this work might be overkill for the actual problem.
- The existing templates are all very specific to React, but the overall concepts don't necessarily need to be.

# Alternatives

- Each Carbon Addons repo follows their own path.
- Manual work to establish a foundation for each business unit.
- Forking a base library to give each business unit a starting point.

# Adoption strategy

- This work has no direct effect on the existing Carbon packages.
- In my opinion, this work needs to be developed as a collaboration by multiple business units for maximum reach.
- New guidelines need to be created to communicate how to create a new Addon for when a new business unit is interested.
- Dedicated slack channel for Carbon Addon teams.

# How we teach this

- We can initially announce the intention at a Feducation and then return with some playbacks as work begins.
- Dedicated slack channel for Carbon Addon teams.

# Unresolved questions

- How do we handle ownership of the tooling?
- How do we handle versioning?
- Should this be open source?
- Should this be specific to Carbon?
