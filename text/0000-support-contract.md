# Summary

A clearly defined contract for how we engage with and support our wider community.

# Motivation

An important part of building a community is making members of that community feel that
they are not ignored. We have failed in the past to respond effectively to new PR submissions
or provide clear responses to bug reports.

By defining a clear contract of how we respond to these incoming submissions and issues, we create
an expectation, but also a measure for ourselves to ensure we are engaging with our community. By
combining this with a dedicated support capacity, we give ourselves a good chance of success.

# Detailed design

It's important that we provide clear feedback to our community, and help ensure their needs are met.

This should support anyone who is trying to get an error or bug fixed in Carbon, and also anyone who is trying to contribute to Carbon in the form of a pull request.

Our contract should be;

- All new bugs and pull requests are triaged on a daily basis. Bugs will be designated as low priority or high priority.
- All bugs and pull requests will receive a comment from a member of the Carbon team within 3 business days of submission
- A fix, or a workaround, or a general timeline to resolve, will be added to high priority bugs within 7 business days of submission, and within 14 business days for low priority bugs
- The member of the Carbon team who provides the first reply to a pull request submission will be the submitters "buddy", and will make best efforts to either assist in reaching a point the pull request can be merged, or provide clear feedback on why the pull request cannot or will not be merged

For each minor release, at least one developer and one designer will be part of a "Support" team who's main accountability is managing this process.

# Drawbacks

Potentially creates a bottleneck around whoever is working on the "Support" team for a release cycle.

Might create false expectations that we can't manage.

# Alternatives

We've tried to say "we'll cover it as part of our ongoing work" and this has never succeeded.

# Adoption strategy

Document this process.
Assign people to a clearly defined "Support" team.
Write a blog post.

# How we teach this

n/a

# Unresolved questions

To be determined by feedback after practising this change.
